# Overview

This is a prototype developed as a group project during my time at university for the course DECO2850, aimed at addressing the challenges faced by shared house residents in managing financial budgeting and cost distribution. The prototype was designed as a finance communication tool to help housemates efficiently and fairly organize their shared expenses and debts to one another.

For this project, I primarily worked on the frontend development of the app, creating the styles and functionalities of screens like 'Dashboard', 'History' and 'Household'. I had also worked on secondary screens too, fixing/refining stylings and debugging.
